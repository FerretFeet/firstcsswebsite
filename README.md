# firstcsswebsite
This is my first project building a webpage with CSS and HTML.  This is a simple blank landing page that could be used for a website, styled using flexbox.
I had some issues using border-radius, namely on sec3 contents, the border would not be rounded, but looked cut off if I used a percentage.  Used px value instead.
Otherwise, I felt pretty confident with what I was doing, and am proud of the page I was able to make.
All images owned by myself.
